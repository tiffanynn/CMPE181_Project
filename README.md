# CMPE181 Project
by: Christine Nguyen, Jennifer Yang, Tiffany Nguyen, and Jia Cherng Ng


Our project is going to focus on object detection (also specializing in driver plate detection). We will also take this project up to another level by hoping that our detection tool will be able to accurately extract the text from the shown license plate.

## Individual Contributions
**Christine:**
1. Researched reference materials


**Jennifer:**


**Tiffany:**
1. Set up the Github repository for the team
