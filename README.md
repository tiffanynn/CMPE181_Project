# CMPE181 Project
by: Christine Nguyen, Jennifer Yang, Tiffany Nguyen, and Jia Cherng Ng


Our project is going to focus on object detection (also specializing in driver plate detection). We will also take this project up to another level by hoping that our detection tool will be able to accurately extract the text from the shown license plate.

## Individual Contributions
**Christine:**
1. Researched reference materials
2. Browsed through multiple sample code
3. Provided Installation packets for the project: 

   a. **Pip**
   
   b. **OpenCV**: open-source machine learning library
   
   c. **Pytesseract**: a Tesseract-OCR Engine to read image types and extract the information present in the image

4. Installed pip, OpenCV, and Pytesseract
5. In the process of running more code examples

**Jennifer:**


**Tiffany:**
1. Set up the Github repository for the team
2. Also downloaded reference materials and tools that Christine found
3. Have been playing around with the sample code so far 
4. Planning to commit working code into the repository


**Jia Cherng:**
1. Researching the fundamentals of object detection
2. Reading github references and browsing sample code
3. Installed required installation packets
4. Discussing future work plans and schedule with team members.
